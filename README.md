# ALD-EVRP data:
The real world data from Singapore Coca-Cola.

File 1: Customer2ID.txt
  The number of customers in data files are serial numbers generated by Coca-Cola. eg. 502785770.
  This file will map such serial numbers to the Virtual Number from 1 to 1987.
  
File 2: ODMatrix.txt
  This file is a distance matrix file. 
  Each row contains three number (a,b,c), where a and b are customers' Virtual Number and 
  c is the distance in real-life between a and b.

[Speed 0]

180.0  540.0 0.0 0.81
570.0 690.0 0.0 0.5
750.0 840.0 0.0 0.81

Explaination
(1) Initial speed of the vehicle is 0.7.
(2)between time 0 to time 30, the acceleration is a=(0.5-0.7)/30 and the initial speed is 0.7. 
  Therefore, the speed at each time t is :
  0.7+(0.5-0.7)/30*(t-0)
(3) the first plat speed time zone from time 30 to 90, the speed is 0.5. 
(4) between time 90 to time 180, the acceleration is a=(0.81-0.5)/(180-90) and the initial speed is 0.81. 
    Therefore, the speed at each time t is :
     0.81+(0.81-0.5)/(180-90) * (t-90)
 (5) the first plat speed time zone from time 180 to 540, the speed is 0.81.
